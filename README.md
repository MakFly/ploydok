Ploydok is a pre-release, open-source, self-hosted PaaS for deploying web
applications, APIs, background services and databases on your own VPS. It is
designed as a pragmatic alternative to Dokploy, Coolify, CapRover, Heroku,
Railway, Render and Vercel for teams that want Git-based deploys, Docker
runtime control, blue/green rollouts, framework guardrails and clear operations
without running Kubernetes.

Ploydok is being hardened toward the daily production workflow: connect a repository, deploy
an app, attach domains and databases, scale replicas, inspect logs, monitor
runtime health, recover safely, and keep the host clean over time.

> **Production readiness:** the current repository is suitable for development
> and controlled staging evaluation. It is not yet approved for public
> production workloads. The blocking security, recovery and release gates are
> tracked in [PRD-PLAN.md](./PRD-PLAN.md).

## Why Ploydok

Ploydok is built for operators who want a small, inspectable deployment
platform instead of a large cluster stack.

| Need                       | Ploydok approach                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy from GitHub         | Repository import, branch tracking and webhook deploys                             |
| Evaluate GitLab            | Backend and provider connection exist; the complete browser journey remains beta   |
| Deploy an OCI image        | Create an application directly from a public or authenticated image                |
| Run many frameworks        | Dockerfile, Nixpacks and framework-specific env guardrails                         |
| Scale apps over time       | Docker Swarm services, replicas, service updates and runtime monitoring            |
| Avoid downtime on deploy   | Blue/green runtime model and Swarm `start-first` updates                           |
| Keep storage under control | Runtime image cleanup, registry garbage collection and build cache hygiene         |
| Operate from a VPS         | One-line installer, systemd supervision, Caddy ingress, Postgres and Redis         |
| Keep accounts secure       | Password login, TOTP, backup codes, passkeys on HTTPS origins and session controls |

Ploydok currently targets one Docker Swarm node. Multi-node scheduling and
stateful rescheduling are not supported for the first production milestone.

## Features

### Application Deployments

- Deploy web apps, APIs and services from Git repositories.
- Dockerfile and Nixpacks build paths.
- Framework detection from repository files and manifests.
- Runtime env and secret handling for build-time and runtime phases.
- Production deployments and beta preview deployments.
- GitHub provider integration and webhook-driven auto-deploy.
- GitLab provider integration in beta while its browser journey is completed.

### Scaling and Rollouts

- Docker Swarm runtime mode for long-lived application services.
- Replica scaling per application.
- Blue/green deployment model.
- `start-first` updates for cleaner reloads.
- Healthcheck-aware deployment status.
- Runtime reconciliation so stale DB state follows real running services.

### Framework Guardrails

Ploydok adds framework-aware defaults before deploy so common 502s are caught
or repaired early.

- Laravel: `APP_KEY`, safe cache/session defaults when no external store exists.
- Symfony: `APP_SECRET`, `APP_ENV=prod`, `APP_DEBUG=0`.
- PHP: runtime port and web-root handling.
- Next.js: Node runtime defaults and container host binding.
- Hono and Node APIs: host/port/runtime guardrails.
- Python: Django, Flask and FastAPI process defaults.
- Rails and Phoenix: secret key checks.

### Databases and Services

- Provisioned databases managed as runtime resources.
- Connection reveal and database env injection.
- Adminer integration for database inspection.
- Runtime monitoring for app and database containers.

### Observability

- Workspace dashboard with application status, service health and deploy history.
- Monitoring page for runtime status, CPU, memory, uptime, restarts and images.
- Runtime logs and live status updates.
- Health pings and stale/offline agent states.
- Authenticated Prometheus collection, Alertmanager paging and measurable
  deployment/queue/backup SLIs; see the [operations runbooks](./OPERATIONS.md).

### Security and Operations

- Password login, TOTP, backup codes and passkey enrollment.
- WebAuthn passkeys on trusted HTTPS origins.
- HttpOnly access and refresh cookies.
- mTLS between API and agent in production TCP mode.
- Image signature verification in installer flows; immutable bootstrap and
  digest promotion remain release blockers.
- Host CLI for upgrade and uninstall. Fresh-host recovery is not yet certified.

## Supported Stacks

Ploydok is framework-friendly rather than framework-locked. It can deploy any
containerized workload and has extra guardrails for popular stacks.

| Ecosystem                 | Examples                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| JavaScript and TypeScript | Next.js, Hono, Node.js APIs, React frontends           |
| PHP                       | Laravel, Symfony, generic PHP apps                     |
| Python                    | FastAPI, Flask, Django                                 |
| Ruby                      | Rails                                                  |
| Elixir                    | Phoenix                                                |
| JVM                       | Spring Boot through Dockerfile or build tooling        |
| Custom                    | Any app with a Dockerfile or compatible Nixpacks build |

## Install on a VPS

Production releases publish a signed bootstrap bundle after every image and
quality gate succeeds. Replace `1.2.3` below with an existing release:

```bash
version=1.2.3
alert_webhook_url="https://alerts.example.com/ploydok"
asset="ploydok-bootstrap-${version}.tar.gz"
base="https://github.com/MakFly/ploydok/releases/download/v${version}"
curl -fSLO "${base}/${asset}"
curl -fSLO "${base}/${asset}.sha256"
curl -fSLO "${base}/${asset}.sigstore.json"
sha256sum -c "${asset}.sha256"
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle "${asset}.sigstore.json" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/MakFly/ploydok/\.github/workflows/release-images\.yml@refs/tags/v.*$' \
  "${asset}"
tmp_dir="$(mktemp -d)"
tar -C "$tmp_dir" -xzf "$asset"
commit="$(cat "$tmp_dir/COMMIT")"
sudo env PLOYDOK_REF="v${version}" PLOYDOK_EXPECTED_COMMIT="$commit" \
  PLOYDOK_VERSION="$version" PLOYDOK_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL="$alert_webhook_url" \
  bash "$tmp_dir/bootstrap.sh"
```

Do not pipe a mutable branch directly into a root shell. `edge` remains
available only for controlled development evaluation through the explicit
`PLOYDOK_ALLOW_EDGE=1` opt-in.

Install in coexist mode when another proxy already owns ports 80 and 443:

```bash
sudo env PLOYDOK_REF="v${version}" PLOYDOK_EXPECTED_COMMIT="$commit" \
  PLOYDOK_VERSION="$version" PLOYDOK_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL="$alert_webhook_url" \
  bash "$tmp_dir/bootstrap.sh" --mode=coexist --yes
```

The webhook must be an HTTPS endpoint that accepts the standard Alertmanager
webhook payload. The installer refuses a production setup without an explicit
receiver, because silent alerts do not satisfy the production gate.

The installer deploys the control plane as a single-node Docker
Swarm stack by default. Docker Compose remains available only for explicit
local and test workflows (`--runtime=compose`).

The installer:

- clones the installer into `/opt/ploydok-installer`;
- installs Docker when missing, unless `--skip-docker-install` is provided;
- creates the `ploydok` system user;
- writes runtime descriptors under `/opt/ploydok`;
- stores mutable data under `/var/lib/ploydok`;
- generates platform secrets and mTLS material;
- configures authenticated Prometheus collection and Alertmanager paging;
- verifies the authenticated API scrape, Prometheus-to-Alertmanager discovery
  and receiver reachability from Alertmanager's egress network;
- pulls and verifies platform images;
- renders Docker Compose and systemd units;
- starts the platform and waits for health checks;
- installs `ploydok-cli` on the host.

The disaster-recovery candidate is documented in [OPERATIONS.md](./OPERATIONS.md):
signed and encrypted off-host backups, checksum verification, 30-day retention
and a mandatory fresh-host restore drill before production approval.

### Install Modes

| Mode             | Use when                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `takeover`       | Ploydok should own ports 80 and 443. Existing nginx/apache config is backed up. |
| `coexist`        | Another edge proxy keeps TLS and forwards to Ploydok on local ports.            |
| `bootstrap-http` | Temporary first setup over HTTP from a controlled VPS security group.           |
| `abort`          | Preflight only. Prints what would happen and exits.                             |

Useful flags:

```bash
--unattended
--manage-firewall
--public-host=example.com
--public-scheme=https
--public-port=443
--http-port=8080
--https-port=8443
--install-dir=/opt/ploydok
--data-dir=/var/lib/ploydok
--version=<tag>
--image-registry=<registry>
```

For production, use a real HTTPS domain. Browser passkeys require a secure
WebAuthn-compatible origin. Raw HTTP on an IP address is only suitable for
temporary bootstrap access.

## Upgrade workflow (pre-release)

Run upgrades from the host with the installed CLI:

```bash
sudo ploydok-cli upgrade --version=1.2.3
```

Default upgrades aim to roll the control plane while keeping the data plane
stable. Database rollback compatibility and fresh-host restore remain required
release gates; take an independently stored backup before testing an upgrade.

| Component                                                        | During `upgrade`                       | Notes                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ploydok-api`, `ploydok-web`, `ploydok-agent`, `ploydok-adminer` | restarted                              | New images are pulled and applied.               |
| `ploydok-caddy`                                                  | not restarted by default               | Use `--include-data-plane` for ingress releases. |
| `postgres`, `redis`                                              | not restarted unless image tags change | Patch releases usually leave them alone.         |
| User apps                                                        | not touched                            | Runtime app containers keep serving traffic.     |
| User databases                                                   | not touched                            | Provisioned databases keep running.              |

Safety checks:

- control-plane database snapshot before upgrade;
- compose file backup before upgrade;
- image signature verification;
- readiness check after upgrade;
- rollback to the previous compose file if readiness fails.

Uninstall while preserving data as a tarball:

```bash
sudo ploydok-cli uninstall --yes
```

Restore a previous nginx/apache edge proxy as part of uninstall:

```bash
sudo ploydok-cli uninstall --yes --restore-previous-proxy
```

## Local Development

Requirements:

- Bun 1.3 or newer
- Node.js 22 or newer for tooling
- Docker
- Rust stable for the agent and host CLI

Install and start everything in one step (dependencies + secrets + local infra +
credential check + migrations + stack verification + dev servers):

```bash
make install
```

`make install` ends by running the dev servers in the foreground, so it stays
attached until you press Ctrl-C. Use it on a fresh clone or after pulling
changes that touch infra or migrations. Before starting the servers it runs
`make check`, which probes every component for real and aborts the install if
one of them is down.

Or run the steps individually:

```bash
bun install          # workspace dependencies
make infra-up        # postgres + redis + caddy + buildkitd + registry + agent
make db-ensure-auth  # wait for postgres, realign the role if the volume drifted
make db-migrate      # apply database migrations
make check           # probe the whole stack and print the /setup URL
```

`make check` connects to Postgres and Redis, calls the Caddy admin and registry
APIs, stats the agent socket, compares applied migrations against the journal,
and — while no admin account exists — prints the first-boot wizard URL:

```
http://localhost:5173/setup
```

Outside production that URL needs no token: the page asks the API for a setup
session and the token is handed over in an `HttpOnly` cookie. In production the
token stays mandatory in the query string, and `make check` prints it from
`PLOYDOK_SETUP_TOKEN` (generated by `make secrets-init`) instead of the
30-minute one the API logs when the variable is unset.

Run the development servers on an already-installed checkout:

```bash
make dev
```

A postgres volume keeps the role password chosen at its first `initdb`, so
rotating `PLOYDOK_PG_PASSWORD` in `apps/api/.env.local` breaks authentication
until the role is realigned. `make db-ensure-auth` detects that mismatch and
repairs it in place, without touching your data.

Local ports:

| Service        | URL                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Web            | `http://localhost:5173`         |
| API            | `http://localhost:3335`         |
| Caddy admin    | `http://127.0.0.1:2020/config/` |
| Local registry | `http://127.0.0.1:5000/v2/`     |
| Postgres       | `127.0.0.1:5434`                |
| Redis          | `127.0.0.1:6381`                |

Useful commands:

```bash
bun test
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
bun run check:spdx
bun run audit:dependencies
bun run db:migrate
bun run db:generate
```

Agent and host CLI:

```bash
cd agent
cargo test
cargo build --release
```

## Security Model

Ploydok is designed for production self-hosting, but the current pre-release
does not yet satisfy every production gate.

- Access token: 10 minutes.
- Refresh token: 7 days, rotating.
- Cookies: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` when public origin is HTTPS.
- TOTP and backup codes for second-factor and recovery.
- Passkeys through WebAuthn on secure origins.
- Agent communication protected with mTLS in production TCP mode.
- Secrets encrypted at rest with the configured master key.
- SPDX `AGPL-3.0-only` headers enforced in CI.
- Responsible disclosure: see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
- Production SLOs and paging runbooks: see [OPERATIONS.md](./OPERATIONS.md).
